File: AmericanRiverInfo_ALL.arff 
Info: Contains 110 instance of the water years
1901 to 2010. Contains the raw data with all the attributes.

File: AmericanRiv_Train.arff
Info: Same as AmericanRiverInfo_ALL.arff except
it also has the water year as an attribute and it's whittled down to ~220 attributes 
and some of the years may be removed.
Years:1901-2010

File: AmericanRiv_Forecasts3.csv/AmericanRiv_Forecasts3.arff
Info: The first attribute is the forecast and determines the cutoff between real data and
averaged data. 
For instance the instance with 1-Apr-00 as the value for FCAST_DATE would have data
up to and including March but everything after March is the averaged values. 

The AmericanRiv_Forecasts3.arff is identical to AmericanRiv_Forecasts3.arff except
it does not have the FCAST_DATE attribute.
Years:1-Feb-00 through 1-May-10

File: AmericanRiv_Test1.arff
Info: Same as AmericanRiver_Train.arff except it only has the last 10 year
i.e. 2001-2010
Years:2001-2010
